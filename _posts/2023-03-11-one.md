<b>Modern day machine learning (ML) applications</b> have revolutionized the way we live, work, and interact with technology. ML is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the development of algorithms and models that can learn from data, and use that knowledge to make predictions and decisions.

One of the most prominent applications of ML today is in the field of natural language processing (NLP). With the increasing amount of text data available on the internet, ML algorithms can be trained to understand and interpret language like a human being. NLP is used in a variety of applications, from speech recognition and translation to sentiment analysis and chatbots.

Another major application of ML is in image and video recognition. ML models can be trained to recognize objects, people, and events in images and videos, which has applications in fields like security, healthcare, and entertainment. For example, ML algorithms can be used to detect signs of disease in medical images, or to identify criminal suspects in surveillance footage.

* Although there are several applications for image recognition, Tesla self-driving cars are<br>one of the best examples of application of ml in image recognition.

ML is also being used to automate and optimize various business processes, such as supply chain management, marketing, and customer service. By analyzing large amounts of data, ML algorithms can identify patterns and insights that humans might miss, and use that knowledge to improve business outcomes. For example, ML can be used to predict demand for products, or to personalize marketing messages based on a customer's behavior and preferences.

In recent years, ML has also been applied to the field of robotics, with the development of robots that can learn and adapt to their environment. These robots can be used in a variety of applications, from manufacturing and logistics to healthcare and agriculture. For example, ML-powered robots can be used to automate repetitive tasks in factories, or to assist healthcare professionals in performing surgeries.

Overall, modern day ML applications are diverse and far-reaching, impacting nearly every aspect of our lives. As the technology continues to advance, it is likely that we will see even more innovative and transformative applications in the future.
